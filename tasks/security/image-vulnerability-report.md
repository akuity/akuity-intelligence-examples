schedule: "every day at 9am"
suggest contexts: instance, cluster

Generate a security-focused report on container image vulnerabilities across all managed clusters.

## Vulnerability Scan Analysis

- Query all container images with CVE scanning enabled
- Group vulnerabilities by severity: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- For Critical and High severity CVEs, include:
  - CVE ID and description
  - Affected image name and tag
  - Workloads using the affected image (Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets)
  - CVSS score if available
  - Fix availability status (fixed version available or not)

## Top Vulnerable Images

- Identify the top 10 images with the highest vulnerability count
- List their deployment locations (namespace/workload)
- Note any images running in production namespaces

## Remediation Priorities

- Highlight images with Critical CVEs that have available fixes
- Identify images with known exploited vulnerabilities (if detectable)
- Flag any images older than 90 days that may need updates

## Scan Coverage

- Report on images that lack vulnerability scan data
- Identify any scan failures or incomplete scans

## Summary Format

Present findings in Markdown with:
- Security posture score (percentage of clean images)
- Trend comparison with previous scan
- Prioritized list of images requiring immediate attention
- Recommendations for remediation
